We aim to test the hypothesis of the role of bias in recommender systems. We will study how the gender of musical artists influences the recommendations given by recommender systems. To do so, we will focus on three different recommender systems and analyze the output recommendations by these systems through the input of datasets that include the gender of musical artists in order to determine if these recommender systems have a gender bias.
We will test the following hypotheses:

1. The number of recommended songs by male artists is proportionately higher than that of female artists.

2. The mean of the ranked recommendations of songs by male artists is higher than that of female artists.

3. The genre that we believe will be male dominated/biased is rap.
